# Goal of the application
User is able to search a country and find relevant information for each country. The user can also view the capital of the location on a different tab.

## User Interface
When user types country name in a search engine, country names suggestions appear depending on if the user input is part of a country's common name

From the view, user can learn several information about each country:
1. Capital name
2. population
3. Native languages
4. Country's flag

## APIs used in this project
Google Map API: Locates the city with longitude and latitude that was obtained from a country API
RestCountries API from University of Helsinki. This website was used to fetch the JSON object of each country, and I was able to pass in different values.
